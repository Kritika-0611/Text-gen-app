# Prompt-Based Text Generation Web App

This is a simple, clean web application that allows users to generate human-like text based on the prompt they provide. It uses a pre-trained language model to create meaningful completions or continuations, making it helpful for writing assistance, idea generation, or creative exploration.

## What This Project Does

This app lets users input any text-based prompt and returns a generated continuation using a language model. It’s ideal for exploring how text generation models work in real time through a lightweight and intuitive web interface.

Built using:
- Streamlit (for the user interface)
- Hugging Face Transformers (for model loading and inference)
- A modular Python structure for maintainability

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**
//bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generator-app.git
cd text-generator-app

2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5. Launch the streamlit app
   streamlit run app.py
This will open a local server in your browser where you can interact with the app.

Tips for Better Results
Prompt engineering matters. Try giving clearer, more detailed instructions:

"Write a formal email to a client about a delayed delivery"

"Continue this poem in the style of Robert Frost"

"Summarize the benefits of using solar energy in three bullet points"
